# Bug Fix Report: approve_article.php Fatal Error

## 🐛 Issue Description
**Error:** `Fatal error: Uncaught mysqli_sql_exception: Unknown column 'table_name' in 'field list'`
**Location:** `approve_article.php:24`
**Date Fixed:** May 27, 2025

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
The error was caused by the `article_audit_trigger` attempting to insert data into an `audit_log` table with columns that didn't exist:

1. **Trigger Issue**: The `article_audit_trigger` was trying to insert into columns:
   - `table_name` ❌ (doesn't exist)
   - `operation` ❌ (doesn't exist) 
   - `record_id` ❌ (doesn't exist)
   - `old_values` ❌ (doesn't exist)
   - `new_values` ❌ (doesn't exist)

2. **Actual Table Structure**: The `audit_log` table only had:
   - `id` (auto_increment)
   - `action` (varchar)
   - `created_at` (timestamp)

3. **Secondary Issue**: The `ApproveArticle` stored procedure was checking for `status = 'pending'` (lowercase) when the database uses `'PENDING'` (uppercase).

## ✅ Resolution Steps

### 1. Fixed the Trigger
**Dropped and recreated** `article_audit_trigger` with correct column mapping:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER article_audit_trigger
AFTER UPDATE ON articles
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO audit_log (action, created_at) 
    VALUES (
        CONCAT('Article UPDATE - ID:', NEW.id, ', Status changed from ', OLD.status, ' to ', NEW.status),
        NOW()
    );
END;
```

### 2. Updated the Stored Procedure
**Fixed case sensitivity** in `ApproveArticle` procedure:
- Changed `status = 'pending'` → `status = 'PENDING'`
- Changed `status = 'approved'` → `status = 'APPROVED'`

### 3. Enhanced PHP Implementation
**Updated** `approve_article.php` to use the stored procedure instead of manual SQL:
```php
// Before: Manual SQL with potential trigger conflicts
$update_stmt = $conn->prepare("UPDATE articles SET status = 'APPROVED' WHERE id = ?");

// After: Clean stored procedure call
$stmt = $conn->prepare("CALL ApproveArticle(?, ?)");
$stmt->bind_param("is", $article_id, $approval_notes);
```

## 🧪 Testing Results

### ✅ All Tests Passed
1. **Stored Procedure Test**: Successfully approved article ID 77
2. **Trigger Functionality**: Audit log entry created correctly
3. **Notification System**: User notification created with proper message
4. **PHP Syntax**: No syntax errors detected
5. **Database Integration**: All triggers and procedures working harmoniously

### Sample Test Results:
```
Testing ApproveArticle Stored Procedure...
Before: Article 'gagsag' status: PENDING
Stored Procedure Response: Article approved successfully (Status: success)
After: Article status: APPROVED
✅ SUCCESS: Article approval working correctly!
```
